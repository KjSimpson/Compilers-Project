# Compilers-Project
A Lexical analyzer and Syntax analyzer for a toy language from a Compilers course.

# The Context Free Grammar
The grammar given to Bison is contained within CFG.txt

# Running
The y.tab.c file is tweaked to ensure it works correctly with the lex file.
After compilation, the resulting executable takes piped in test files and performs 
the analysis with the resulting lexical tokens and the actions of the syntax analyzer.
